# 453 Final Project
## An improved anonymity model
### Charles Dudley and Joao Lira

This project contains an algorithmic implementation of the anonymity model outlined
    in https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cpe.3902. This anonymity model
    combines notions of k-anonymity, l-diversity, and a novel $$\alpha$$ measure to
    generalize public datasets.

## k-anonymity
## l-diversity
## $$\alpha$$
This metric strengthens the privacy guarantees of k-anonymity and l-diversity
    by restricting the portion of a cluster that sensitive attributes of an
    sid may occupy.
